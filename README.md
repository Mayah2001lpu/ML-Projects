Project Overview

This project tackles image classification using a Machine Learning model to identify different types of adorable animals in pictures!

We'll be utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve this feat.

Getting Started

[ ]  Check if you have Python 3.7 or later installed (python --version in your terminal).[ ]  Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/imagen-classification-cute-animals.git
